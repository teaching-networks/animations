<p>
	You have not compiled the web app into the /public folder of this server, thus there is nothing shown.
	<br>
	Nevertheless you can use the servers REST API, which may be useful for developing where you can use the AngularDart webdev compiler and just rebuild the server without completely building the web app and copying all files over to the servers /public folder.
